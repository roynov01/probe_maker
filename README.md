## Instructions

1.	The instructions are written in the left (from top to bottom), and more detailed instructions will appear at the blue label.
2.	Go from the top to the bottom. Besides the choosing of the working directory, every step is independent.
3.	Even if you don’t use the built-in “search by name”, its best to insert a name, so all the files will be named accordingly (no need to hit the accept button).
4.	All the files from each step will be saved at the chosen directory.
5.	Most steps will copy to the clipboard the things needed for the next stage to save even more time/energy.
